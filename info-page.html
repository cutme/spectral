			<h3>
Preventive maintenance contract
			</h3>
			
			<p>
In the preventive maintenance contract (PM) we cover the necessary support to keep your equipment in shape. Based on the type of system that you have, how it is used and what the consequence would be of possible down time we agree on a suitable frequency and what things should be maintained, cleaned, updated or aligned.
			</p>

			<p>
The contract includes all costs for traveling and living expenses related to the planned visits.
			</p>

			<h3>
Extended support contract
			</h3>
			
			<p>
In addition to the maintenance covered in the PM contract you might want to include some additional items, a number of free repair visits, an annual training day, software updates, etc. Add these from a menu of options to create your extended contract.
			</p>

			<h3>
Full support contract
			</h3>
			
			<p>
To provide you with a fixed running costs and an insurance against any unexpected incidents it is possible to sign a full service contract that not only includes preventive maintenance and free repair visits but also free spare parts.
			</p>

			<h3>
General
			</h3>
			
			<p>
With any of the support contracts you have your own service engineer that can be reached with a mobile phone number and email. Your engineer will get to know both you and your instrument, its history and how to manage it in the best way. When needed additional resources can be called in for specific work, but your contact will remain in charge.
			</p>

			<p>
If you are located in different country our travel expenses and travel time will never be more than if we would be based in your country capital. For planned preventive maintenance the travel expenses are always included in the PM contract.
